# frontend practice

 I've committed a collection of frontend mini projects to this repository, showcasing my work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects highlight my ability to build responsive, interactive, and visually appealing web components. The repository includes:

> - A **responsive navigation bar** with dropdowns and mobile-friendly design
> - A **contact form** with validation and styled input fields
AND MANY MORE TO DO AND WILL ADD THEM ALSO
 Each project reflects my hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, CSS styling techniques, and event-driven programming. This repository serves as a practical showcase of my frontend development skills and creative problem-solving.
